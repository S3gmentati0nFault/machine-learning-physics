This repository contains the solutions for the exercises proposed during the course of Machine Learning and Physics (2023) provided at Heidelberg University.
<br>
The solutions to the exercises have been uploaded and never reviewed, thus they might contain small errors and imprecisions. I feel like they should be used to understand how much work usually gets put into the proposed assignements.
<br>
Credits for part of the work go to Mario Massimo, who is helping me solve the exercises
