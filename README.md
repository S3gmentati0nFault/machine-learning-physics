This repository contains the solutions for the exercises proposed during the course of Machine Learning and Physics (2023) provided at Heidelberg University.
<br>
The focus for this repository is shifting, I want the solutions in this repo to represent an
alternative to the ones proposed by professors in their own <a href="https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/mlph2023-Exercises">official repository</a>.
<br>
I don't like most of their solutions and find the code a bit confusing and basically unreadable
(also thanks to Python, which is not helping). Thus in the future I'm going to try and come up with
the solutions for the exercises on my own (guided of course by their material due to how hard the
argument is).
<br>
Credits for part of the work go to Mario Massimo, who is helping me solve the exercises
